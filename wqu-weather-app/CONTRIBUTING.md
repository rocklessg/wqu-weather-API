# How to contribute

Contributions are welcomed and opened to all students of the WQU Unit I Data Science module of the summer 2020 session. To contribute, follow these steps.

1. Unless there's an issue open that your contribution will address, create a new issue. Please explain the purpose of your proposed changes.
1. Create a branch with your changes. Make sure to follow the git and code styles shown in the sections below.

1. Create a pull request (PR). Make sure to tag the issue your PR addresses.
1. Add xofbd as the reviewer and assignee.

Ideally, I (xofbd) will be able to get back to you within a few days but please allow for a week before I finally respond.

## Git style
Follow the guidelines below when making commits.
1. All commit message must start with a capital letter
1. Use the present tense, e.g., "Remove repeated code"
1. The commit's first line should be a summary of less than 50 characters long.

## Code style
Please follow Python's official coding style, outlined in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) has a nice tutorial over the PEP 8 style guideline.
